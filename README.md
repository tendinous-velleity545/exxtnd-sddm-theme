# MacOS-Like black&white SDDM theme 
[README_RU.md](https://github.com/exxtnd/exxtnd-sddm-theme/blob/main/README_RU.md) (RU VERSION)

Black&White minimalistic SDDM theme based on Qt6. This theme inspired by MacOS 26 Tahoe. There is no liquid glass and other trash.

## Features
* Without unnecessary dependencies of KDE, you can install it with any DE/WM
* The avatar changes automatically if there is an image named ``.face.icon`` in your user's home directory. If not, the fallback image will be displayed.
* User's choice when clicking on the avatar
* Quick access to session management
* Other familiar functions
